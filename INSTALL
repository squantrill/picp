"make install" tries to copy the executable ("picp") into
/usr/local/bin. You will probably need to be root to do this.  If this
is not where executables live on your system, copy it manually.

For help just type "picp". A quick summary of command line arguments
will be displayed.

To see a list of supported devices, type "picp -d".

Picp has compiled and run successfully without warnings or complaints
