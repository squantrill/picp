TODO list (12 January, 2005):
----------------------------

There is a report that USB serial ports don't work in RedHat9. Using the
2.4.26 kernel solves the problem. If information on a workaround for this
becomes available, modify the port init routines to make it work with RH9.

For which chips does the data eeprom address entry in the PIC_DEFINITION
need to be set? (See 12F629/75 and 16F630/76.)

In DoEraseConfigBits (picstart.c), erase config bits may not be correct for all
devices.

Add diagnostic code to test Picstart Plus/Warp-13 (need info on command
code 0x43)?

In picdev.c, need to add code protect and watchdog masks to definition
structures for most parts.

Verify program space.

Verify data space.

Erase oscillator calibration (probably unnecessary since none of the current
flash devices have calibration space).

Support osc. calibration space sizes other than 1 (PIC14000 only?).

Seems to have trouble verifying oscillator calibration when stringing several
operations together.

Seems to have a problem with 16C63A (but not 16C63, which MPLAB appears to
treat as identical).
